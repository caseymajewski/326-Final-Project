# Terrarium Water Tracker

# A program that tracks daily water intake and produces a terrapin-themed terranium visual based on water goals achieved.

Our project is a  water intake tracker that encourages users to reach their average daily water intake through fun animations and visuals. The main animation is a terrapin in a terranium that gradually fills up with water starting from the bottom of the tank, per every glass the user drinks in a day. The goal for the user is to create a terranium that is entirely full of water and the terrapin can easily swim around in it. If our user drinks additional water after achieving their daily water intake, than other fun water-based plants an animals will pop up for their enjoyment. These visuals were created using the pygame module.
