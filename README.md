# 326 Final Project: Terrarium Water Tracker

# A program that tracks daily water intake and produces a terrapin-themed terrarium visual based on water goals achieved.

Our project is a  water intake tracker that encourages users to reach their average daily water intake through fun screens and visuals. The main visual is a terrapin (our lady Testudo) in a terrarium that gradually gets more elaborate with added details, toys, and friends for Testudo, per every glass the user drinks in a day. The goal for the user is to create a terrarium that is the ideal place for Testudo to hang out :D. These visuals were mainly created using the tkinter module and the Figma UI application.
