# 326 Final Project: Terrarium Water Tracker

# A program that tracks daily water intake and produces a terrapin-themed terrarium visual based on water goals achieved.

Our project is a  water intake tracker that encourages users to reach their average daily water intake through fun screens and visuals. The main visual is a terrapin (our lady Testudo) in a terrarium that gradually gets more elaborate with added details, toys, and friends for Testudo, per every glass the user drinks in a day. The goal for the user is to create a terrarium that is the ideal place for Testudo to hang out :D. These visuals were mainly created using the tkinter module and the Figma UI application.

# How to run our program:

Please navigate to the terrarium.py script, as that is our main script. Run it in the terminal. You should get five pop up questions about personal information: age, sex, weight, height, activity level. Answer those questions. After you complete this series of questions, another pop up will appear notifying you of what your calculated daily water intake is. Our program then sends you to a water logging screen. At the top of this screen, center in the window, is a little button that says "I Drank Water". Please click this button to input how much water (in ounces) that you have had to drink. Based on the number you input, our calculations on the backend will take you to a specific benchmark screen depending on how close you are to completing your water intake goal for the day. Continue to click the "I Drank Water" button at the top of the screen to log each ounce of water, and eventually reach your daily water intake, where Testudo has a surprise for you.
